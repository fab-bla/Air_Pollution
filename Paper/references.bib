	abstract = {In recent years, China has experienced severe and persistent air pollution associated with rapid urbanization and climate change. Three years' time series (January 2014 to December 2016) concentrations data of air pollutants including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) from over 1300 national air quality monitoring sites were studied to understand the severity of China's air pollution. In 2014 (2015, 2016), annual population-weighted-average (PWA) values in China were 65.8 (55.0, 50.7) μg m−3 for PM2.5, 107.8 (91.1, 85.7) μg m−3 for PM10, 54.8 (56.2, 57.2) μg m−3 for O3\_8 h, 39.6 (33.3, 33.4) μg m−3 for NO2, 34.1 (26, 21.9) μg m−3 for SO2, 1.2 (1.1, 1.1) mg m−3 for CO, and 0.60 (0.59, 0.58) for PM2.5/PM10, respectively. In 2014 (2015, 2016), 7\% (14\%, 19\%), 17\% (27\%, 34\%), 51\% (67\%, 70\%) and 88\% (97\%, 98\%) of the population in China lived in areas that meet the level of annual PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2 standard metrics from Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards-Grade II. The annual PWA concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, O3\_8 h, NO2, SO2, CO in the Northern China are about 40.4\%, 58.9\%, 5.9\%, 24.6\%, 96.7\%, and 38.1\% higher than those in Southern China, respectively. Though the air quality has been improving recent years, PM2.5 pollution in wintertime is worsening, especially in the Northern China. The complex air pollution caused by PM and O3 (the third frequent major pollutant) is an emerging problem that threatens the public health, especially in Chinese mega-city clusters. NOx controls were more beneficial than SO2 controls for improvement of annual PM air quality in the northern China, central, and southwest regions. Future epidemiologic studies are urgently required to estimate the health impacts associated with multi-pollutants exposure, and revise more scientific air quality index standards.},

	abstract = {We examine the impact of China's hukou system, which is an institution controlling population movement, on social and economic outcomes at the individual level. Using data from a recent Chinese household survey, we find that people who obtained urban hukou late in their lives fared significantly less well than other urban residents. They have fewer years of education, are less likely to hold state sector jobs and to have employer-provided healthcare benefits, and are more likely to be self-employed or unemployed. A rural–urban comparison that controls for factors commonly believed to affect migration decision reveals that the two major contributing factors to rural–urban inequality are low educational attainment among rural population and low rewards to education in rural employment. Since the hukou system denies rural population the access to education and urban employment, we argue that the hukou system is a major contributing factor to rural–urban inequality. We also estimate the value of an urban hukou to rural individuals. Journal of Comparative Economics 33 (1) (2005) 133–157.},

	abstract = {The paper constructs and analyzes a long-run time series for regional inequality in China from the Communist Revolution to the present. There have been three peaks of inequality in the last fifty years, coinciding with the Great Famine of the late 1950s, the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, and finally the period of openness and global integration in the late 1990s. Econometric analysis establishes that regional inequality is explained in the different phases by three key policy variables—the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.},
