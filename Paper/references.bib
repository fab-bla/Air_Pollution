The current situation will be further challenged in the future by an aging population, an increasing need for privatization and growing expectations about quality of healthcare.},

	abstract = {We examine the impact of China's hukou system, which is an institution controlling population movement, on social and economic outcomes at the individual level. Using data from a recent Chinese household survey, we find that people who obtained urban hukou late in their lives fared significantly less well than other urban residents. They have fewer years of education, are less likely to hold state sector jobs and to have employer-provided healthcare benefits, and are more likely to be self-employed or unemployed. A rural–urban comparison that controls for factors commonly believed to affect migration decision reveals that the two major contributing factors to rural–urban inequality are low educational attainment among rural population and low rewards to education in rural employment. Since the hukou system denies rural population the access to education and urban employment, we argue that the hukou system is a major contributing factor to rural–urban inequality. We also estimate the value of an urban hukou to rural individuals. Journal of Comparative Economics 33 (1) (2005) 133–157.},

	abstract = {The paper constructs and analyzes a long-run time series for regional inequality in China from the Communist Revolution to the present. There have been three peaks of inequality in the last fifty years, coinciding with the Great Famine of the late 1950s, the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, and finally the period of openness and global integration in the late 1990s. Econometric analysis establishes that regional inequality is explained in the different phases by three key policy variables—the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.},
